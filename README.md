# Noise Gen

This is a stupid little application to generate noise gifs. Currently not uber efficient (and actually broken atm too while I decide whether to
work with a config or a CLI interface) but hey, other than that it works.

To get this to work right now, comment out all of the Clap code and set the noise yourself.
